Sailors at sea

Every man searches for something
a deserted treasure chest
on an island not found on the maps of man

the nothern star is their compass
its alignment with the other stars
tells a story
a story beatiful and true
of sailors at sea 
searching for the one piece
a mythical treasure 
which contains everyting the world can offer
 
Every man is searching for a purpose
a deserted treasure chest
on an island not found
on the maps of the sky.
